# Prototype-Game
This might be the greatest idea, or the worst idea ever. 


So, I am not really doing that much bot development anymore, but I still like to program, I want to dabble back into game development, and probably mod designing. A smart thing to do would be to start with a small mod, and maybe work my way up to a game, but that's the smart thing, and I'm not about that life. So this is my attempt at trying to make a game.

Details currently unknown, I am just trying to mess around and find out if anything sticks.

I am also using unity for the time being, I might move over to something like Unreal Engine, or I might just go to mod development, but this is my git for my game.

This is not my first game, my first game was more of a "teenager who does not know what he is doing, just being a messy programmer and slapping things together"

Should I continue with this project, I hope that it is actually perfected and something that is more than that.
